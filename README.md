# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tom Scheers

## About
I've been learning to program since May of 2023, and I've learned about various technologies. I started out with learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Eventually, I got more into Python and backend, I've also been specializing in C recently, which I quite enjoy.  

## Projects
I've made several projects in languages like Python and C, here are a few examples:
- [ASCII-powered Facecam](https://github.com/tomScheers/nFace) | C
- [Bingo Card Generator](https://github.com/tomScheers/Bingo_Card_Generator) | C
- [Chess](https://github.com/tomScheers/Chess) | Python  
And much more to come!
